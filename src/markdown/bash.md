No matter the language, I always find bash scripts in the cracks of my projects. I mean, who needs any CI/CD integration other than a folder full of `.sh` files? This site itself just has a few deploy scripts for dev and production environments. Anyways, there are plenty of reasons why someone would love bash, here are some of mine.

### Automagic

Why type more?

### Do the Cron

For decades, dark lore in the crontab speaks of tasks repeated by servers executing bash scripts. Cache-flushing and site-health check scripts.

### .bashrc and the Dot Files

I hope this band plays at my funeral.
