// Cold Lib SCSS V0.0.5

/***************************************/
/* Cold Lib is my (Cole Geerts https://colegeerts.com) "Bootstrap-esque" sass library 
   with focusing on creating a default theme with potential retheming options.
   Although I want this project to become standalone one day, most of it's effort
   and contributions have happened over the course of other projects. Sort of 
   like a leech per se. As such some of what appears here is project-specific,
   but as the version number increments with big changes, that will happen less
   and less.
